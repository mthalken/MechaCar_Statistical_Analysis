## The analysis
### Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- Both the Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance provided a non-random amount of varince to the mpg values indicating they have a significant impact on mpg. The intercept was also shown to be statistically significant indicating there are factors not within the dataset that contribute to the mpg value. 

- The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because of the significant differences between the independent variables and must reject the null hypothesis.

- The linear model does predect mpg protoypes effectively (shown in the R-Squared value of 0.7149) at 71% accuracy.
